link.c :All linked list operations.
subarraytree.c :A program that inputs data elements and stores them into a tree.All distinct elements are stored to the right and same elements to the left of each element.
For ex:
Data elements 1,2,1,3,4,1,3,4,5,1,4,3 will be stored in the tree as:
                          1
                        /  \
                       1    2
                      /      \
                     1        3
                    /       /  \
                   1       3    4
                          /    / \
                         3    4   5
                             /
                            4
This reduces the time in finding the number of occurences of a particular element.
As tried and tested,this program can work for around 700 elements.
